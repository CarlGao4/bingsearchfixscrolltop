# Fix for Bing Search

Tampermonkey Script to FIX "Bing Search returns to the top of page"

On Bing Search, when you leave the tab for more than 15 seconds and return back to Bing, there is a function to automatically scroll the page to the top.

As I found this behaviour a little annoying, I made a Tampermonky script to block that.

## How to Install

If you already have Tampermonkey installed, you could download the script file here and install it in the extension.

[I also uploaded the script to GreaseFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/461790-fix-for-bing-search-returns-to-the-top)

Follow this link to install the script in one-click.
